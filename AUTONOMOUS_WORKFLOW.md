# 🤖 InitRepo Autonomous Agent Workflow

## Overview

**Minimal Human Intervention Required!** The InitRepo Claude Agent now provides fully autonomous project building through Claude Code slash commands. Set it up once, then let the AI do the work.

## 🚀 Complete Autonomous Workflow

### Phase 1: One-Time Setup
**Human Input Required**

```bash
# 1. Install the agent globally
npm install -g initrepo-claude-agent@latest

# 2. Navigate to your project
cd /path/to/your/project

# 3. Ensure you have InitRepo documentation structure
# Your project should have:
# - docs/business_analysis.md
# - docs/prd.md
# - docs/user_stories.md
# - docs/technical_architecture.md
# - docs/README.md (with tasks)

# 4. Setup Claude Code integration
initrepo-claude --setup-claude-code

# 5. Install Claude Code extension
mkdir -p ~/.claude-code/extensions/initrepo-agent
cp -r node_modules/initrepo-claude-agent/claude-code-extension/* ~/.claude-code/extensions/initrepo-agent/
```

### Phase 2: Validation (Optional)
**Human Input: 30 seconds**

```
# In Claude Code CLI:
/initrepo-check
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ MCP server found
✅ Current project: your-project
✅ Documentation folder found
✅ Setup check completed successfully!
```

### Phase 3: Autonomous Building
**Human Input: 1 command, then hands-off!**

```
# In Claude Code CLI:
/initrepo-agent
```

**What Happens Autonomously:**
1. **Discovery** (10-30 seconds)
   - Analyzes project structure and documentation
   - Validates documentation completeness
   - Generates health report
   - Identifies all tasks and dependencies

2. **Planning** (15-45 seconds)
   - Identifies critical tasks requiring implementation
   - Analyzes task dependencies automatically
   - Creates optimal implementation schedule
   - Estimates effort and identifies blockers

3. **Implementation** (1-10 minutes)
   - Systematically implements each task in dependency order
   - Gets context and implementation briefs from MCP server
   - Validates understanding before implementation
   - Implements tasks autonomously with progress tracking

4. **Quality Assurance** (30-60 seconds)
   - Validates cross-references and documentation
   - Checks for orphaned references and gaps
   - Generates final project health report
   - Provides completion summary

### Phase 4: Monitoring (Optional)
**Human Input: Occasional status checks**

```
# Check progress anytime:
/initrepo-status

# Verify specific tasks:
/initrepo-verify T-025

# Comprehensive verification:
/initrepo-verify
```

## 🎯 Minimal Human Interaction Commands

### Primary Commands (95% of usage)

| `/initrepo-status` | **Check progress** | Anytime to see current status and remaining work |
| `/initrepo-verify` | **Validate completion** | After agent finishes, to confirm everything is correct |

### Setup Commands (One-time use)

| Command | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `/initrepo-check` | **Validate setup** | Initial setup and troubleshooting |

### Advanced Commands (Optional)

| Command | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `/initrepo-search <query>` | **Find specific documentation** | When you need to understand specific features |
| `/initrepo-implement <feature>` | **Get implementation plan** | When you want to see the plan before building |

## 📊 Typical User Experience

### Scenario: Email Warming System Implementation

**Total Human Time: 2 minutes setup + 1 command + optional monitoring**

```bash
# Setup (2 minutes, one-time)
cd mail-warm-project
npm install -g initrepo-claude-agent@latest
initrepo-claude --setup-claude-code

# In Claude Code CLI:
/initrepo-check
# ✅ All systems ready

# Start autonomous building (1 command)
/initrepo-agent
```

**Agent Output:**
